# Abstract Data Type - ADT
**Specifies a set of operations (INTERFACE) and its semantics, but doesn't specify the implementation of the operations.**

- It simplifies the task of specifying an algorithm if you can denote the operations you need without having to think at the same time about how the operations are performed.

- Since there are usually many ways to implement an ADT, it might be useful to write an algorithm that can be used with any of the possible implementations.

## TODO
- take examples from good resources:
    - http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/BasicDS/linkedlists.html
    - http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~skrentny/cs367-common/readings/
- refactor current adts (make it more accurate)
- test all adts
- list resources for each adt
- add code for the following abstract data types:
    - container
    - deque
    - list
    - map / associative array / dictionary
    - multimap
    - multiset
    - set
    - string
    - graph
