"""
  Let's take a look at two ADTs:
  - Queue
  - Priority Queue

  Real life examples:
  - in most cases, the first customer in line is the next customer to be served
  - at supermarkets, a customer with only a few items go FIRST
  - at airports, customers whose flights are leaving soon are taken from the middle of the queue

  
  queueing policy
  - the rule that determines who goes next
  - e.g.: FIFO, LIFO, priority queueing

  priority queueing
  - each customer is assigned a priority and the customer with the highest priority goes first, regardless of the order of arrival
