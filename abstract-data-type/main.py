"""
  ADT
  specifies a set of operations (INTERFACE) and its semantics, but doesn't specify the implementation of the operations. That's what makes it abstract!

  - It simplifies the task of specifying an algorithm if you can denote the operations you need without having to think at the same time about how the operations are performed.

  - Since there are usually many ways to implement an ADT, it might be useful to write an algorithm that can be used with any of the possible implementations.
